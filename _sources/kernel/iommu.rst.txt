IOMMU
==========================


The Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) is a component in a memory controller
that translates device virtual addresses (can be also called I/O addresses or device
addresses) to physical addresses. 

The concept of IOMMU is similar to Memory Management
Unit (MMU). The difference between IOMMU and MMU is that IOMMU translates device
virtual addresses to physical addresses while MMU translates CPU virtual addresses to
physical addresses
