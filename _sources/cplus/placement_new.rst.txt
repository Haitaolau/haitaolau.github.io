======================
Placement new operator
======================



Placement new is a variation new operator in C++

Syntax
-------

.. code-block::

   new (address) (type) initializer

As it allows to construct an object on memory that is already allocated, 
it is required for optimizations as it is faster not to re-allocate all the time. 

There may be cases when it is required to re-construct an object multiple times so, 
placement new operator might be more efficient in these cases.
