Gralloc
=============

The graphics memory allocator (Gralloc) is needed to allocate memory requested by image producers.


The Gralloc allocator HAL hardware/libhardware/include/hardware/gralloc.h performs buffer allocations through usage flags. Usage flags include attributes such as:

*    How often the memory will be accessed from software (CPU)
*    How often the memory will be accessed from hardware (GPU)
*    Whether the memory will be used as an OpenGL ES (GLES) texture
*    Whether the memory will be used by a video encoder
