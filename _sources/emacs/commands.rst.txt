C- means "control key", Hold down the control key while
   pressing the next key
M- means "meta key", (“Escape” in the lab, on other
   computers sometimes “Alt”). For meta commands with the
   Escape key, press the Escape key and then release it,
   then press the other key. Thus M-f stands for the
   keyboard sequence "press and release the Escape key", "
   press f".
