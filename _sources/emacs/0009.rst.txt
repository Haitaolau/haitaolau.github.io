 How to close windows in Emacs
===============================


Let's close backtrace windows here as a example

There are several ways to close backtrace windows in Emacs, depending on how you opened them and what you want to achieve:

q (Most Common and Recommended)
---------------------------------

The simplest and most common way to close a backtrace window (or any help buffer, for that matter) is to press ``q``. This command is usually bound to ``quit-window`` and is the standard way to exit help buffers, including backtrace windows.

C-x 0 (Close Current Window)
-----------------------------

``C-x 0`` (Ctrl+x followed by 0) closes the current window. If the backtrace is in the current window, this will close it. If you have other windows open, this will close only the selected window.

C-x 1 (One Window)
------------------

``C-x 1`` (Ctrl+x followed by 1) closes all other windows, leaving only the current window open. If the backtrace is in a separate window, this command will close that window along with any others, leaving only the window with your main editing buffer.

C-x k (Kill Buffer)
-------------------

``C-x k`` (Ctrl+x followed by k) kills the current buffer. If the backtrace is in its own buffer, this will close the buffer and the associated window. However, this is generally less preferred for backtraces because it completely removes the backtrace information, which might be useful for later debugging.

Mouse Click (If Enabled)
-------------------------

If you have mouse support enabled in Emacs, you can often click on the window's close button (if it has one) to close the window containing the backtrace.

C-x C-q (Quit Window and Buffer)
---------------------------------

This will close the window and also kill the buffer associated with it. This is similar to ``C-x k`` but more explicit.

Which Method to Choose
----------------------

*   ``q`` (Recommended): This is the most common and generally preferred method for closing help buffers, including backtraces. It's quick and easy.
*   ``C-x 0``: Use this if you want to close the backtrace window specifically but keep other windows open.
*   ``C-x 1``: Use this if you want to close all other windows and focus on your main editing buffer.
*   ``C-x k`` or ``C-x C-q``: Use these if you want to completely remove the backtrace information from Emacs. However, it's generally better to keep the backtrace information available in case you need it later.

Example
-------

1.  A backtrace window appears.
2.  Press ``q``.
3.  The backtrace window closes.

Key Point
---------

``q`` is the most common and usually the best way to close a backtrace window. It's designed for this purpose and is consistent with how you close other help buffers in Emacs.
