====================
 Lisp: Buffer
====================


Buffer-name
===========

.. code-block::

   (buffer-name)

When I do this in Info, the value returned by evaluating (buffer-name) is "test.txt"

.. code-block::

   (buffer-file-name)

the value returned by evaluating (buffer-file-name) is "/home/wrsadmin/workspace/test.txt"

The two functions, buffer-name and buffer-file-name, show the difference between a file and a buffer.



.. note::

   In the expressions, the parentheses tell the Lisp interpreter to treat buffer-name and buffer-file-name as functions; without the parentheses, the interpreter would attempt to evaluate the symbols as variables


Getting Buffers
===============


The buffer-name function returns the name of the buffer; to get the buffer itself, a different function is needed: the current-buffer function


.. code-block::

   (current-buffer)

If you evaluate this expression in Info in Emacs in the usual way, "**#<buffer test.txt>**" will appear in the echo area


A related function is other-buffer. This returns the most recently selected buffer other than the one you are in currently, not a printed representation of its name. If you have recently switched back and forth from the *0013.rst* buffer, other-buffer will return that buffer.


.. code-block::

   (other-buffer)


You should see #<buffer 0013.rst> appear in the echo area,


Switching Buffers
=================


The other-buffer function actually provides a buffer when it is used as an argument to a function that requires one. We can see this by using other-buffer and switch-to-buffer to switch to a different buffer.


.. code-block::

   (switch-to-buffer (other-buffer))


Buffer Size and the Location of Point
=====================================



.. code-block::

   (buffer-size)

   (point)
