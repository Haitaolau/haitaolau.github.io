============================
 Lisp: The message Function
============================


you can print a message in your echo area by evaluating the following list:

.. code-block::

   (message "This message appears in the echo area!")



.. code-block::

   (message "The name of this buffer is: %s." (buffer-name))

In Info, "The name of this buffer is: *info*." will appear in the echo area. The function

buffer-name returns the name of the buffer as a string, which the message function inserts in place of %s.


To print a value as an integer, use ‘%d’ in the same way as ‘%s’.

.. code-block::

   (message "The value of fill-column is %d." fill-column)


On my system, when I evaluate this list, "The value of fill-column is 72." appears in my echo area5.


.. code-block::

   (message "There are %d %s in the office!"
         (- fill-column 14) "pink elephants")


On my system it says, "There are 58 pink elephants in the office!".


.. code-block::

   (message "He saw %d %s"
         (- fill-column 32)
         (concat "red "
                 (substring
                  "The quick brown foxes jumped." 16 21)
                 " leaping."))


When your fill column is 70 and you evaluate the expression, the message "He saw 38 red foxes leaping." appears in your echo area.
