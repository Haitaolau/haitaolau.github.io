============================================
 Elisp: Case Sensitivity (case-fold-search)
============================================


https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Searching-and-Case.html



By default, searches in Emacs ignore the case of the text they are searching through; if you specify searching for ‘FOO’, then ‘Foo’ or ‘foo’ is also considered a match. This applies to regular expressions, too; thus, ‘[aB]’ would match ‘a’ or ‘A’ or ‘b’ or ‘B’.



If you do not want this feature, set the variable case-fold-search to nil

.. _case_fold_search:

case-fold-search
================

This buffer-local variable determines whether searches should ignore case. If the variable is nil they do not ignore case; otherwise (and by default) they do ignore case.

* <t> means search do ignore case.

* By default, the value is <t>

* <nil> means search is case-sensitive.
