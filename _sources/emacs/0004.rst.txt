**c-h f mark-whole-buffer**

.. code-block:: console

   mark-whole-buffer is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’.

   It is bound to C-x h, <menu-bar> <edit> <mark-whole-buffer>.

   (mark-whole-buffer)

   This function is for interactive use only.
   Probably introduced at or before Emacs version 26.1.

   Put point at beginning and mark at end of buffer.
   Also push mark at point before pushing mark at end of buffer.
   If narrowing is in effect, uses only the accessible part of the buffer.
   You probably should not use this function in Lisp programs;
   it is usually a mistake for a Lisp function to use any subroutine
   that uses or sets the mark.

It marks a whole buffer as a region by putting point at the beginning and a mark at the end of the buffer. It is generally bound to C-x h.

**push-mark**

 - the Lisp interprete sets a mark at the current position of the cursor.

**push-mark (point-max) nil t)**

It sets a mark at the highest numbered place in the buffer that it can. However, in this version, push-mark has
two additional arguments. The second argument to push-mark is nil. This tells the function it should display a
message that says “Mark set” when it pushes the mark. The third argument is t. This tells push-mark to activate
the mark when Transient Mark mode is turned on. Transient Mark mode highlights the currently active region. It
is often turned of
