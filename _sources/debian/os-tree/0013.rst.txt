How to Debug the initrd ?
===========================


The kernel command-line parameter rd.break is a powerful debugging and recovery tool in Linux, primarily used

with modern initramfs implementations like dracut (common in Fedora, RHEL, CentOS) or initramfs-tools (Debian, Ubuntu).


  **rd. prefix**: The rd. prefix in kernel parameters generally indicates that the parameter is intended for the

  initramfs (initial RAM filesystem) environment. These parameters are interpreted by the init script (or systemd instance)

  running inside the initramfs, not directly by the main Linux kernel itself.


  **break**: This part instructs the initramfs to stop the boot process and drop you into an interactive shell (often a BusyBox shell) at a specific "breakpoint."

Specifically, when you add rd.break (without any arguments) to the kernel command line:

    **Early Boot Interruption**: The boot process will halt before the initramfs performs the final switch_root (or pivot_root) operation.

    This means control has not yet been fully handed over to the real root filesystem's /sbin/init (which is typically systemd).

    **Emergency Shell Access**: You will be presented with a root shell prompt within the initramfs environment.

    This shell runs on the temporary RAM-based filesystem of the initramfs.

    **Real Root at /sysroot**: Crucially, at this point, the initramfs has usually already successfully located

    and mounted your actual root filesystem to /sysroot (by default, it's mounted read-only). This allows you to inspect its contents.


Example:

.. code-block:: bash

   sh-5.2# cat /proc/cmdline
   initrd=\ostree\elxr-845a09b4e96e39f3e3fb29a87373436b064645a08b46174385caf9bc21551816\initramfs-6.1.0-29-amd64.img root=LABEL=ROOT
   rw console=ttyS0,115200n8 console=tty0 ostree=/ostree/boot.1/elxr/845a09b4e96e39f3e3fb29a87373436b064645a08b46174385caf9bc21551816/0 rd.break


**/run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt** is a crucial diagnostic file that is generated by dracut (the initramfs generator used by Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, and others) when your Linux system fails to boot and drops into the emergency mode or dracut emergency shell.

Essentially, it's a debug report generated by the initramfs to help you troubleshoot why your system failed to fully boot.
