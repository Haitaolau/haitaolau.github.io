NAME

::
   
  ostree-init - Initialize a new empty repository



SYNOPSIS
========

::

   ostree init [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
===========

::
   
   Creates a new empty repository.

OPTIONS
=======

::
   
   --mode="MODE"
      
      Initialize repository in given mode (bare, bare-user, bare-user-only, archive).
      The default is bare. Note that for archive the repository configuration file
      will actually have archive-z2, as that's the historical name.

      See the manual for differences between these modes. Briefly, bare mode stores
      files as they are, so they can be directly hardlinked, bare-user uses extended
      attributes to store ownership and xattr information, allowing non-root operations,
      bare-user-only does not store ownership information, and archive stores files
      compressed, to be served over the network.

   --collection-id=COLLECTION-ID

     Set the collection ID of the repository. Remotes in clones of this repository must
     configure the same value in order to pull refs which originated in this repository
     over peer to peer.

     This collection ID must be persistent and globally unique. It is formatted as a
     reverse DNS name (like a D-Bus interface). It must be set to a reverse DNS domain
     under your control.

     This option may be omitted (the default) to leave peer to peer distribution unsupported
     for the repository. A collection ID may be added to an existing repository in future to
     enable peer to peer distribution from that point onwards.

     If the collection ID is changed for the repository in future, peer to peer distribution
     of refs from the repository will break for all peers who do not update their remote
     configuration to the new collection ID.
