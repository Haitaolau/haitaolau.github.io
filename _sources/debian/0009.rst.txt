 How to install build dependencies for packages ?
==================================================


Install the build-dependencies on the host system (or in the chroot):

.. code-block:: bash

   apt build-dep debian-installer


Verify that the build dependencies are all met using dpkg-checkbuilddeps. You may still see something like:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dpkg-checkbuilddeps

   dpkg-checkbuilddeps: Unmet build dependencies: grep-dctrl debiandoc-sgml glibc-pic libparted1.6-13 libslang2-pic

which means some build dependencies are still missing. Correct this by installing the missing packages, for example:


.. code-block:: bash

   aptitude install -R grep-dctrl debiandoc-sgml [...]
