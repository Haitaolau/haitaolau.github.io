 How can I specify the repository from which a package will be installed?
==========================================================================


You can specify a repository with **-t** option.


From apt-get manual page:

::

      -t, --target-release, --default-release
           This option controls the default input to the policy engine; it creates a default pin at priority 990 using the specified release string. This overrides the
           general settings in /etc/apt/preferences. Specifically pinned packages are not affected by the value of this option. In short, this option lets you have
           simple control over which distribution packages will be retrieved from. Some common examples might be -t '2.1*', -t unstable or -t sid. Configuration Item:
           APT::Default-Release; see also the apt_preferences(5) manual page.



For example:

I have added the following repository to /etc/apt/sources.list and I would like to install **debootstrap** from elxr repository. 

.. code-block:: bash

   root@a59889bb1f5a:/usr/src/data/config# cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elxr.list 
   deb [trusted=yes] http://mirror.elxr.dev/elxr aria main


As you know there is a same package debootstrap in the official Debian repository. If I want install debootstrap from this specific repo. I should issue:

.. code-block:: bash

   apt-get install -t aria debootstrap
