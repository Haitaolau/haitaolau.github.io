   It's a very low priority cleanup; the Depends is redundant but
   harmless.

   Relevant changes are from September.  The lsb-base package is empty,
   and would have been gone completely if debootstrap understood Provides.

   The description of "$PACKAGE1 => $PACKAGE2" are clear enough, of
   "$PACKAGE => nothing" a bit less, indeed.  You can just drop the dependency.

   "error" but a "mild warning to fix if you're bored".
