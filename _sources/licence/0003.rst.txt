 Open Source: GNU Public License
=================================

Although a copyleft license also allows sharing the code, copyleft licenses do so under certain conditions that are more restrictive than attribution licenses.


According to a copyleft license, you're free to use the software, but it doesn't come as a free beer.


Under a copyleft license, you can copy, modify, and distribute the code, but in exchange for this rights, you must transfer the exact same rights to other subsequent users of this code.


This means that if you modify the code, you must provide your modifications and your derivative work under the same copyleft license that the original code is licensed under.


One of the most popular copyleft licenses is the General Public License, known as GPL.
