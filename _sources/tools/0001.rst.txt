there are several tools on Linux that can convert an image to a text file using Optical

Character Recognition (OCR). The most popular and well-regarded is Tesseract


Tesseract OCR
=============

Tesseract is a free, open-source OCR engine maintained by Google. It's a command-line tool,

but it's very powerful and accurate. You can install it on most Linux distributions using the package manager.

**Basic usage:**


.. code-block:: console

   tesseract input_image.png output_text_file


This will create a new file named output_text_file.txt containing the text it recognized

from the image. You can also specify the language for better accuracy.
