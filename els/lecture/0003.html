<h1>Senate Floor Speech Honoring the Life of Rosa Parks<a class="headerlink" href="#senate-floor-speech-honoring-the-life-of-rosa-parks" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>delivered 25 October 2005, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Mr. President, today the nation mourns a genuine American hero. As most of you know, Rosa
Parks died yesterday in her home in Detroit. Through her courage, and by her example, Rosa
Parks helped lay the foundation for a country that could begin to live up to its creed.</p>
<p>Her life and her brave actions reminded each and every one of us of our personal
responsibilities to stand up for what’s right and the central truth of the American experience
that our greatness as a nation derives from seemingly ordinary people doing extraordinary
things.</p>
<p>Rosa Parks’ life was a lesson in perseverance. As a child, she grew up listening to the Ku Klux
Klan ride by her house, fearing that her house would be burned down. In her small hometown
in Alabama, she attended a one-room school for African-American children that only went
through the sixth grade. When she moved to Montgomery, Alabama, to continue her
schooling, she was forced to clean classrooms after school to pay her tuition. Although she
attended Alabama State Teachers College, Rosa Parks would late – later make her living as a
seamstress and housekeeper.</p>
<p>But she didn’t accept that her opportunities were limited to sewing clothes or cleaning houses.
In her 40s, Rosa Parks was appointed secretary of the Montgomery branch of the NAACP and
was active in voter registration drives with the Montgomery Voter[s’] League. In the summer
of 1955, she attended the Highlander Folk School, where she took classes in workers’ rights
and racial equality. Well before she made the headlines across the country, she was a highly
respected member of the Montgomery community and a committed member of the civil rights
effort.</p>
<p>Of course, her name became permanently etched in American history on December 1st, 1955,
when she was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery
bus. But what’s not as well known is that it wasn’t the first time Rosa Parks refused to
acquiesce to the Jim Crow system. The same bus driver who had her arrested, and had her
thrown off the bus that day, had done the same the year before when Rosa Parks refused to
give up her seat.</p>
<p>Some schoolchildren are taught that Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat because her feet
were tired. But our nation’s schoolbooks are only getting it half right. Ms. Parks once said:
“The only tired I was, was tired of giving in.”</p>
<p>This solitary act of civil disobedience became a call to action. Her arrest led to a then
relatively unknown pastor, Martin Luther King, Jr., to organize a bus boycott for the entire
Montgomery [bus] system. That boycott lasted 381 days and culminated in a landmark
Supreme Court decision finding that the city’s segregation policies were unconstitutional.</p>
<p>This solitary act of civil disobedience was also the spark that ignited the beginning of the end
for segregation and inspired millions around the country and ultimately around the world to
get involved in the fight for racial equality.</p>
<p>Rosa Parks’ persistence and determination did not end that day in Montgomery, nor did it end
with the passage of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act years later. She stayed active in
the NAACP and other civil rights groups for years. From 1965 to 1988, Ms. Parks continued
her public service by working for my good friend Congressman John Conyers. And in an
example of her low-key demeanor, her job in Congressman Conyers’ office did not involve
appearances as a figurehead or celebrity; she helped homeless folks find housing</p>
<p>At the age of six – At the age of 74, she opened the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for
Self-Development, which offers education and job training programs for disadvantaged youth.
And even into her 80s, Rosa Parks gave lectures and attended meetings with civil rights
groups.</p>
<p>At the age of 86, Rosa Parks’ courage and fortitude was recognized by President Bill Clinton,
who awarded her the nation’s highest honor for a civilian – the Congressional Gold Medal.</p>
<p>As we honor the life of Rosa Parks, we should not limit our commemoration to lofty eulogies.
Instead, let us commit to carrying on her fight, one solitary act at a time, and ensure that her
passion continues to inspire as it did a half-century ago. That, in my view, is how we can best
thank her for her immense contributions to our country.</p>
<p>In closing, Mr. President, Rosa Parks once said:</p>
<p>As long as there is unemployment, war, crime and all the things that go to the infliction
of man’s inhumanity to man, regardless – there is much to be done, and people need
to work together.</p>
<p>Now that she’s passed, it’s up to us to make sure that her message is shared. For while we
will miss her cherished spirit, let’s make sure to ensure that her legacy lives on in the heart of
the nation.</p>
<p>And Mr. President, as a personal note, I think it is fair to say that were it not for that quiet
moment of courage by Ms. Parks, I would not stand here before you today. I owe her great
thanks, as does the nation. She will be sorely missed.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.</p>
