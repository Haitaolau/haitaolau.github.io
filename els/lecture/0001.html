<h1>Senate Floor Speech on Ohio Electoral Vote Counting Procedures<a class="headerlink" href="#senate-floor-speech-on-ohio-electoral-vote-counting-procedures" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Delivered 6 January 2005, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Mr. President; Ladies and Gentlemen of the <strong>Senate /ˈse-nət/</strong>:</p>
<p>I have to say that I didn’t anticipate speaking today, but the importance, I think, of this issue
is one in which I feel it’s important for me to address this body.</p>
<p>You know, during the election I had the occasion of meeting a woman who had supported me
in my <strong>campaign/kam-ˈpān/</strong> . And she decided to come to shake my hand and take a photograph. A
wonderful woman, she wasn’t asking for anything, and I was very grateful that she took time
to come by. It was a[n] unexceptional moment except for the fact that she was born in 1894.
And her name was Marguerite Lewis, an African-American woman who had been born in
<strong>Louisiana/lu̇-ˌē-zē-ˈa-nə/</strong>, born in the shadow of slavery, born at a time when <strong>lynchings/ˈlɪntʃɪŋ/</strong> were commonplace,
born at a time when African-Americans and women could not vote</p>
<p>And yet, over the course of decades she had participated in broadening our <strong>democracy/ di-ˈmä-krə-sē/</strong> and
ensuring that, in fact, at some point, if not herself, then her children and her grandchildren
and her great-grandchildren would be in a position in which they could, too, call themselves
citizens of the United States and make certain that this Government works <strong>not just</strong> on behalf
of the mighty and the powerful <strong>but also</strong> on behalf of people like her.</p>
<p>And so the fact that she voted and that her vote was counted in this election was <strong>of supreme
importance</strong> to her and it is the memory of talking to her and shaking her hand that causes me
to rise on this occasion.</p>
<p>I am absolutely convinced that the President of the United States, George Bush, won this
election. I also believe that he got more votes in <strong>Ohio/ō-ˈhī-(ˌ)ō/</strong>. I think, as has already been said by
some of the speakers in this body, this is not an issue in which we are challenging the
outcome of the election. And I think it’s important for us to separate out the issue of the
election outcome with the election process.</p>
<p>I was not in this body four years ago, but what I observed as a voter, as a citizen of <strong>Illinois/ ˌɪləˈnɔɪ /</strong> four years ago, were troubling evidence of the fact that not every vote was being counted.
And I think that it is unfortunate four years later that we continue to see circumstances in
which people who believe that they have the right to vote – who show up at the polls – still
continue to confront the sort of problems that have been documented as taking place, not just
in Ohio, but [in] places all across the country.</p>
<p>I would strongly urge that this Chamber, as well as the House of Representatives, take it upon
itself once and for all to reform this system. There is no reason, at a time when we have
enormous battles taking place <strong>ideologically/ ˌaɪdiəˈlɑːdʒɪk(ə)l /</strong> all across the globe, at a time when we’re try to
make certain that we encourage democracy in <strong>Iraq/i-ˈräk/</strong> and <strong>Afghanistan /af-ˈga-nə-ˌstan/</strong> and other places
throughout the world, that we have the legitimacy of our elections challenged, rightly or
wrongly, by people who are not certain as to whether our processes are fair and just. This is
something that we can fix. We have experts on both sides of the aisle who know how to fix it.
What we’ve lacked is the political will.</p>
<p>I would strongly urge that, in a circumstance in which too many voters have stood in long
lines for hours, in which too many voters have cast votes on machines that jam or malfunction
or suck the votes without a trace, in which too many voters try to register to vote only to
discover that their names don’t appear on the roles, or that partisan political interests and
those that serve them have worked hard to throw up every barrier to recognize them as
lawful, in which too many voters will know that there are different elections for different parts
of the country and that these differences turn shamefully on differences of wealth or of race,
in which too many voters have to contend with state officials, servants of the public, who put
partisan or personal political interests ahead of the public in administering our elections – in
such circumstances, we have an obligation to fix the problem.</p>
<p>And I have to add that this is not a problem unique to this election, and it is not a partisan
problem. Keep in mind, I come from Cook County, from Chicago, in which there is a long
record of these kinds of problems taking place and disadvantaging Republicans as well as
Democrats. So I would ask that all of us rise up and use this occasion to amend this problem.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
